PROJECT SUMMARY

Prisons are designed to break people. Infrastructure has outgrown us, and imprisons us. 
Automation threatens to render the working class obsolete, and the states warehouses obsolete workers in prisons.
Factories sucked anyway. There is a long history of Luddite resistance against factory work, and in favor of artisan skilled labor.

What sort of artisan skilled labor is available to workers today? Instead of selling the concept of smallness or localness,
we update the knowledge base, to provide modern, competitive and well paying work to people who would otherwise be 
treated like robots.

OpPrisonPlanet is a tentacle of IGRR meant to squirm through the walls of prisons and the informal caste system of capitalism.
The goal is to reach out and empower each other, to use education, data, and scientific methods to reduce the number of individuals
incarcerated, and to increase the quality of life for everybody.
