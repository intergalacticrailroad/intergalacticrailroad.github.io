Fermentation, Decomposition, Ecology, and Medicine

DIYBIO contains blueprints and manuals for the reproduction of biological processes. 
It also contains research papers, notes about research, and contact information.
There is alot of work to be done here!

Fermentation
	-Beer, whiskey, fuel
	-Saurkraut, and lactofermentation
	-Isolation of specific substances from a broth, as in penicillin or berberine.

Decomposition and Ecology
	-Composting, and the production of soil
	-Predicting the flow or movement of a decomposing body over time
	-Elementary cycles; carbon, nitrogen 
	-Mushroom cultivation
	-Timescales of decay; when will the house fall down, etc
	-Scaling mutualism

Medicine
	-hardcore biochem, and systems biology
	-water quality testing
	-archive of medicinal information
	-karyotyping, and genetic experiments
		-mendels peas, breeding animals/plants
		-methods of genetic identification
		-lowest cost tools for chromosomal study

These are just suggestions, to get started.
