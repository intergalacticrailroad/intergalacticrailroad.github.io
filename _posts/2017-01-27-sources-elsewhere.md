I've been working on the space rails, all afternoon, making a list of interesting resources, archives, and data sets. Please add to our collection! Remember folks, heat dissipates, and chains don't break themselves. Strike while the iron is hot, so we can get something rolling up here. Pass a note under the table, throw us an airplane. Send us an email. Tell yer ma i said hi.



OPEN COURSE WARE

Learn shit, on your own damn time! These links will take you to course material that has been made available for public use by the muckity mucks at MIT, and other institutions. The good parts, in my opinion, are all pdfs and video lectures. Astonish your friends with your newfound knowledge! Rub cyber-elbows with Yale! Download and study today!

I've got feelings for the MIT set of courses in particular.

Publiclab.org is another big chunk of things you should all be shoving into your eyes. The project describes itself as a "DIY environmental science community." They are very edgy, and probably funded by George Soros. How could they not be? Sharing? Free blueprints? For the community? WHWHWHWWWWWWAAAA???? 

They have a focus on DIY aerial photography, and mapping. I saw instructions on how to make your own water, air, and soil testing kits on there, as well as detectors for mapping the dispersal of oil industry crud. Slick shit.

In response to pharmaceutical company assclowns jacking up the price of the Epipen, these guys published a paper on how to make your own epipen for $30 using generic products. FTV got brownie points. Also, make all your own medicine! Welcome to the age of biohacking. Try not to break anything you can't replace.

SciHub was breaking down the walls of scientific journals before it was cool, and earned a giant lawsuit instead of a thank you. But for those of you who speak russian, scihub.ac is the O.G.

This is not a real website.

A real railroad, though.
