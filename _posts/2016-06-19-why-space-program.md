Why a Space Program? 

It's an excuse to be great. To learn, build, envision a long future and a successful one. 

It's a chance to plot the future, apply our theories of human reality and ecology to the scale of history. We can survive on this planet, or the next one, or the next one. We have lots of time and space to work out our humanity. When we look back on this era, it could be the bottleneck through which the posthuman squeezed, along with the Gaian ecology, and splurted out to fill the galaxy. There's no reason we can't come together and do amazing things. And there's a lot of things to be done. 

The Independent Space Program is successful in one way: if more freedom spreads in space. We have to create optionality, literally make space for new modes of life to emerge. The Program is antifragile. It spreads, mutates, reacts to the environment and becomes stronger and more streamlined. We are the space whale we want to be. 

We are a slime mold of the future, a sporulating spreading coming-together of energies. You get some people together and learn microbiology, I join a hackerspace and build robots, someone else gets a welding torch and a backyard shop. We join together over drinks and work parties, taking small steps on our way to the stars. We run into another group with the same intentions. They've got oxygen scrubbers and ballistics calculus. 

We keep bouncing around, taking a long view, incorporating everything we can into the long-term flow. We can head together into the future, fixing the problems we face and moving on to the next. We can pass the mission on to our children, give to their capable hands our launchpads and libraries, secure in the knowledge that the Program is being carried out. 

The Space Program is Turing-complete machine running a halting-problem program.
