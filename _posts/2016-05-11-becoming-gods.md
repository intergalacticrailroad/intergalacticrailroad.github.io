### Becoming like Gods (Doing the Dishes)

Anarchists are always talking about who does the dishes and how does that make them right. That is the essence of Goop. Who got the food, who cooked the food, who cleaned the ex-food off the dishes. The Goop is the physical substrate of life. In proper relation to the Peeps and the Maths, the Goops allow us to spend our time building a Space Program. When the Goops are not fueling the Peeps, or the Goops are in the way of the Peeps or getting mixed up in the Maths, then we are not building a Space Program. The Goops are the lubricant in our meatspace projects. And cyber projects, for that matter. We need to keep the dishes washed so that people can cook with them so that we can eat so that we can learn calculus. This is the essence of Goops. If we are to become all-powerful space-traveling mind-melding grey-gooing gene-writing Dyson-sphering tranarchists, then we need to do the dishes. If we Become Gods without getting over Petty Bickering, we will destroy everything. "You didn't wash Mars this week. I knew you wouldn't, because you're blah blah blah!" Death ray. Bam.
