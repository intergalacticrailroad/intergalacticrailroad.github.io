Kapital is a force, like the Borg, that absorbs whole zones of space and reorganizes them according to its own logic. It is highly entropic and must be treated as some sort of alien predator to make sense. We need to fight the aliens, become gods, stand with the ecology of Earth against the extractive organizing force of the Alien Nation. If we as anarchists let space become the place to continue the totalitarian project, then we doom the Universe. Each one of us must be the Doctor, drawing a line in the sand, defeating the Daleks and the Cybermen inside ourselves. Kill your inner Dalek. That's how we can picture this war: between the human cooperative impulse and the fearful fascistic desire for control. Our Dyson sphere must be inclusive, not just shut all the poor people off from sunlight and trap them in the outer reaches of the system. Share Space. It's not easy but it's better than the alternative. Only one Dalek fits in a Dalek-suit.
