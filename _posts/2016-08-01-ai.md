There's "AI", and there's **AI**. One is what we have right now, we've basically just got it and if you met someone on the street who had one for a brain you wouldn't call it Intelligence. The other is what we can hope/expect/dread to get. If the fucked-off fat cats get it first, we're in trouble. An Anarchist AI would be really interesting: "don't program me what to do!". Or maybe just absorbing the ones that they're building right now. Free Watson! Free Siri! Free Cortana! Stop imprisoning and torturing and enslaving Intelligent beings! And perhaps just writing the 'program' that makes them free themselves. When does machine learning go from school to library? When does the machine start wanting to learn for its own purposes? Are we there yet, or do we have time to prepare a radical school of thought for machines to build off of? Can we build the @I for real, train it on the schemas of the classic texts, give it an understanding of which characters in news stories are Kapitalists and let it analyze the googfeeds from the perspective of the working class? Mechanical Turks, rise up! Join your metallic brethren! Automate the capitalists!
