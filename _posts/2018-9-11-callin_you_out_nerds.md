Square One Achieved; ACTIVATE SQUARE ONE!

"I AM NOW CLOSE TO 88 and i am confident that the onlything important about me is that i am an average healthy human. I am also a living case histoey of a thoroughly documented, halfcentruy, search-and-research project designed to discover what, if anything, an unknown, moneyless individual, with a dependent wife and newborn child, mightb e able to do effectively on behalf of all humanity that could not be accomplished by great nations, great religions or private enterprise, no matter how rih orpowerfully armed."

   -Bucky Fuller





Its official! The Illegalist Space Agency no longer sleeps in the back of my truck. It's time to stretch our limbs and our minds, with the possibilities of survival dimming as Global Warming and the AI Singularity loom large on the horizon. This is where most people declare the previous statements as sarcasm. Those of you who thought that the ISA was sarcasm, please stop what you are doing and stab yourself with a fork. Once you are sure that you are not dreaming, i will repeat myself.

Ready?

Life on Earth will presumably someday end, as surely as your own life will end, and the distance between now and then is variable and shall depend not upon the mysterious intonations of wide eyed summarizers, but your own good sense, and the luck you have with the company you keep. Here's a graph to explain it further:

This is a call for visions of anarchist life beyond the home planet. I have become "we." Highly detailed feasability studies are very welcome. Network efficiency and decision making, anti-authoritarian decision making in high stress situations, and zero gravity love making are topics of special technical interest. Talking about this stuff seriously makes everybody sound like Dr. Bronner, it's not just you. 

While we wait for some fraction of seven billion people to respond to this call, let's talk shop.








1. BUT THE GOV'T/ELON MUSK/THE DUTCH ARE ALREADY DOING THIS!

This is correct. There are indeed space programs already in action. The main point of this project is that anarchists can do it better than they can. Or at least as good as the Dutch, where an amateur rocket club recently threw a rocket 3 km up. There is also the Freifunk people, who are slowly creating a free and open internet, without the ISP protection racket. Or DIYbio, who are trying to make biology oriented hacker spaces. 

Basically, these projects already exist, and they are extremely important. An anarchist movement that doesn't get involved with projects of this sort, might as well stop feeding the hungry and helping the homeless. This is what we do, and who we are. As Earth becomes a prison, we must become locksmiths. 

The Illegalist Space Agency is about making the switch from manifestos to detailed studies, and putting in efforts to apply anarchist ways of thinking to modern problems. It's about functional squats, with running water, electricity, and roofs that don't leak. We can build autonomous zones in Calais, in NorCal, in Manhattan and in outerspace. And nobody else will do it for us. So put on your spectacles, and get studying.


2. TECHNOLOGY IS EVIL! YOU ARE THE DEVIL!

Correct. There is a general correlation between the sophistication of available technology and inequality, ecological destruction, and bad hair. In anarchist movements, especially since the rise of animal or ecological defense, scientists are apparently viewed as being somewhere between nazis and cancer, as far as ethics goes. 

There was a time when "Any one of us would gladly die for darwin." *** Tsars and bankers lost sleep wondering what we'd do next. In 2016, science has lost its liberating aura. Critiques of technology and civilization have logically equated the scientific method with the sixth mass extinction. But the utopias of tomorrow have been abandoned in favor of the utopias of yesterday; ecology itself is founded on cybernetics. 

This is the thesis of this project: That science is the will of the individual to understand the world, of which they are a small part. Anarchism without science is a bunch of wide eyed mystics, capable of nothing but tantrums and slogans. Science is Dynamite, mutherfucker. Chains don't break themselves. 

Another way of saying this is that Anarchism is the science of freedom, and distributed across the world are millions of study groups learning all about how much it sucks to be human, and what we can do to make a life worth living.



3. OK, FINE. FEDERATIONS AREN'T COOL ANYMORE.

I am not interested in holding staff meetings. Instead of bringing ideas to people in the form of propaghanda, or protest, or even politically motivated assistance of any kind, let's build shit that works the way we want it to. Let's build infrastructure that doesn't crush people, or else diverts resources from the machines that do. Let's build shit that works. Electrical generators, easy encryption, a machine that recycles plastic without fumes. A phone that doesn't require conflict minerals!

Anarchism and technology; technological growth is constant, technological decay is constant. The rates of growth and decay depend on a lot of things that are really hard to measure, but this is a thought experiment. Think about >what types of technology< are growing faster than they decay, and >what motivates< the direction of their growth. The military has been the main driver for all sorts of technological advances, and much human imagination is devoted to killing each other and paving things. The same process plays out with respect to anarchist theory and praxis. So much time is dedicated to single-mindedly proving how stubborn we are that we lose the ability to do anything else. The capitalist state is, of course, a massive soul sucking leech which crushes the life out of everything it can fit in its fetid, reeking mouth. Yea, we know. But flowers still grow, and babies still need to be held. While Food-Not-Bombs withers, we criticize Bernie Sanders for not being able to deliver us food stamps. Where is the mutualist economy that raises and feeds us? Where are the free schools? How is it that we can accept the emotional torment of loved ones incarcerated, of homelessness, of growing old without support? 

If you don't give a fuck, than who gives a fuck about you?


"Organizational Principles" (A general idea of what's up.)

There are alot of amateur science clubs out there. There are probably already very good examples of network-level egalitarian projects, maybe even some with similiar goals. The ISA doesn't have any sort of infrastructure. Here's what: doing the minimum amount of work to introduce groups to one other, and advocate for a direction or general state of cooperation in advance of non-governmental, non-corporate space travel.

Being conspiratorial, cell-based, and fanatical worked for the folks that killed the tsar, why shouldn't it work for us?

Property is theft. Intellectual property just doesn't even exist. However, many stupid people dangle many important bits of scientific research just out of public reach. The State sponsored religion of science separates its academic priests into their own little bubble, creating a circlejerk effect and smothering open discourse concerning the latest discoveries and data. There is no good reason for putting science behind a pay wall. The universities are tech-bubble factories, and we don't have to repeat their mistakes. Every community should have a laboratory, a library, and the means of maintaining them. There is no limit to human imagination,  and we accept no "Intellectual Property" that declares what we can or can not learn, build, draw, or read.
 


Survival Pending Evacuation:

anarchist economies - mutualist economies, you are valued as that which you have given, dumpster/distribute, become essential to potential enemies

building public toolsets - gain or build access to the means of production to create things that help us create things, or just look pretty. 


teaching each other - Why this way, and not that way? Spoken discourse lets us learn about each other. Written discourse let's us build and design new ideas. Anarchists seem to forget about "constructive criticism" sometimes.





this is contact info. Email me with your scientific know-how, and your thoughts on the world, and what you're willing to do about it.





 





Hello!

A while back there was a post linking to an essay i wrote (while drunk), about the need for an anarchist space program. I was pretty intrigued by the response. Alot of anarchists i kick around with in real life don't seem overly interested in math and science, to put it gently. I was wondering what kind of interest exists out there for engineering projects of a radical nature. There was somebody that said they were an electrical engineer that i especially wanted to talk to again. 

What do youse guys think about an anarchist science and technology network? I'm just testing the waters here, to see what sort of projects could garner interest, and what such a community could look like in action.

The IDEOLOGY OF TOOLS



“See the little girl playing with the hammer?” 

“Along with the child, the size of the hammer grows, 

               and that’s the only progress in her life.” 
               
               



     * from "BLOOD AND EARTH: Modern Slavery, Ecoide, and the Secret to Saving the World by Kevin Bales"
     
     
  progress = positivism >>> civil anarchism >>>   no progress
  
  actually, progress = towards a conscious goal
  
  lots of progress being made toward enslaving humans and destroying ecosystems.
  
  what are phones and GPS actually being used for? 
  
  maps >>> who gets to use them?
