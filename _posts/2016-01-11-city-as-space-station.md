A city is a homeostatic habitation. The whole point of the place is that it creates its own ecology. So when the anarchists move to space, or take over the city, the problem is the same. How do we take care of the massive infrastructural organization that we need for humans to live densely and create the ecology that sustains itself? Currently cities take a huge amount of resources from all over the planet and distribute them to the networked World-City, but it wasn't always that way and it doesn't have to be. If we relocalize all production, consumption and waste cycles, how big is a city? How far out does Seattle extend before it can just draw a boundary and say "i fit in here"? Given, the size and shape are dynamic. But that dynamic equilibrium is the nature of  life, of an organism. If we can get that into the equation, aim the cities toward being self-sufficient ecologies and then aim that knowledge at space rocks, then we can get the terraria made of asteroids and the Mars-spanning cooperative government. Then we can help Earth, by providing models and testing grounds for infinite different modes of life. If your subculture can't sustain itself in space, how do you expect it to scale? Can Communism, Democracy, Capitalism, or your preferred flavor of ideological ice cream, can it sustain indefinite dynamic equilibrium on a rock flying through space with only a given amount of insolation to power it? If not, then drop that shit like a bad habit, cause that's exactly the situation we're in. Welcome to Spaceship Earth. How would you like to help?
