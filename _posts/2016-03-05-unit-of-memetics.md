The problem with the early science of memes was that we didn't have any evidence about the fundamental unit itself, the meme. We were speculating based on possibilies and populations and general trends. Phenotypes instead of memotypes. The metameme, the idea of memetics itself, spread from book to mind to new-writ book, but the actual science didn't progress because of the lack of granularity. We couldn't get a close enough resolution on the memoscope. But then we did a grand experiment, which I'm not sure people knew was the point of what they were doing. The act of spreading the idea of "the meme", and creating this sort of soup of the Net where all human interaction could mutate with high fidelity and instant reproduction, gave us a place where ideas of memes could variate hugely. The Internet ran a generative algorithm using its wetware components, and the question was: what is the memeatom? What is the smallest and most generic meme? We got it. It's some words on a picture. It's a context field with a vector. It connects two seemingly disparate ideas, sensations, in a way that forces your mind to forge a new neural connection instantaneously. And spontaneously, because no two minds have the same context fields and so the vectors differ infinitely. From this we can build a true Memetics, an engineering discipline and a science, because we can take apart the memeplexes into their context-vectors and then test those in isolation until we get an understanding of how they work. And we have the biggest database ever. We can do statistical analysis on memes and we can do mass experimentation in the virtual petri dishes of the Wired. We are the meat programmers. We are the meme.
