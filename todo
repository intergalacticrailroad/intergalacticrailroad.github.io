IGRR hatchling
	-absorb initial proposals, present proposals to the wired
	-absorb feedback via .io site and a protonmail account
	-agglomerate interest, but not too much interest, lets not facebook
	-the hatchling could be a fundamental unit of IGRR
		-contain links to databases, project goals timelines and working groups
		-reproducable and easy, until you specialize into something new
		-thus, the git = eggfile
			this could be a torrent or what have you
	-props to the RailYardGhosts
	-a bridge between traveling culture and the scientific community

raspi
	-she needs more power, captain! can't support two usbs, much less an external hard drive
	-nonlocal hosting = better security in this case; raspi is an easy target
	-peer review across the house! (across the LAN)
	-feedback makes me write more, work more. and i wanna read your shit too. yes you.
	-raspi is gangster shit. i just love doin gangster shit.	


vpn
	-vpn to push new filessss;;;;;;;;is this necesary? too much of a pain in the ass?
	-bitmask might work. bitmask is a bit annoying to update. It's beta. It functions as a vpn against wingnut opponents.
	-installing bitmask via ssh... will it blow the ssh-mind?

igrr.git.io
	-looks about as good as ensorcel right now.
	-looks like it will never be updated (like enscorcel)
	-not enough data! more data! links to data! self aggrandizing fictional data! this is SCIENCE, GOD DAMN IT
	-project explanations: target audience? means of cooperation? who's into this?
	-post release support for former inmates?
